autopkgtest (4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  Please adjust your existing CI system/scripts for the new CLI, tools, and
  API introduced in version 4.0:

  * This release adds a new "autopkgtest" CLI. This provides a simplified CLI
    compared to the now deprecated adt-run; see the changelog for details.
    The old "adt-run" CLI will still be available for some time.
  * The adt-build* tools got renamed to autopkgtest-build*, and now build
    images prefixed with"autopkgtest" instead of "adt". There are
    compatibility symlinks for the old commands, and when being called through
    them, also produce images with the old adt* names.
  * The public ADT_* env variables got renamed to AUTOPKGTEST_*:
    - AUTOPKGTEST_APT_PROXY
    - AUTOPKGTEST_ARTIFACTS
    - AUTOPKGTEST_AUTOPILOT_MODULE
    - AUTOPKGTEST_NORMAL_USER
    - AUTOPKGTEST_REBOOT_MARK
    - AUTOPKGTEST_TMP
    As these are being used in existing tests and tools, they are also
    exported/checked under their old ADT_* name.
