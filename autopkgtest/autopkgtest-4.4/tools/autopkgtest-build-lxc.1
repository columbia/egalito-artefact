.SH NAME
autopkgtest-build-lxc \- Create or update autopkgtest container for autopkgtest-virt-lxc

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B autopkgtest-build-lxc
.I distribution release
.RI [ architecture ]
.RI [ script ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B autopkgtest-build-lxc
creates or updates an LXC container \fBautopkgtest-\fIrelease\fR which is suitable for
autopkgtest's LXC runner \fBautopkgtest-virt-lxc\fR(1).

It calls
.B lxc-create
with the
.I distribution
template (which can currently be
.B debian
or
.B ubuntu) and
.BI -r release
to build a debootstrap-like container, then enables
.B deb-src
apt sources, and runs
.B apt-get update\fR.

It defaults to the native architecture, but you can specify a different one as
third parameter.

The path to a script to be executed inside the container to customize the
container can be passed as the fourth parameter. The script must be a POSIX
shell script, and should not depend on bash-specific features.

If the container already exists, it updates it as unintrusively as possible by
first creating a new temporary container \fBautopkgtest-\fIrelease\fB.new\fR, and then
rsyncing its root file system back to the existing \fBautopkgtest-\fIrelease\fR. Note
that this could cause some side-effects and breakage if you have running
containers with ephemeral overlays (i. e. using the
.B --ephemeral
option), but it does work in general. This update process does not interfere at
all if you use
.B autopkgtest-virt-lxc
with cloning.

Note that you need to call this as root, unless you set up LXC to allow
per-user containers. But user containers will not work with many or even most
autopkgtests.

You can specify an apt proxy to use in the container in the
.B $AUTOPKGTEST_APT_PROXY
environment variable. If you have an apt proxy configured on the host,
the container will automatically use this, otherwise there is no default.
